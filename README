This repo provides build files to compile the libs used by the EasyRPG project
for Visual Studio easily.

Provided build types:
VS2005 (Only release build is maintained):
/O2 and /MT enabled.
CPU requirements: Intel Pentium or newer (you probably have this)
The only exception is pixman_mmx which was compiled with MMX support.
CPU requirements for MMX: Intel Pentium 2 or newer, AMD K6 or newer
OS requirements: Win98 or newer

VS2010: (Target v100 runtime by default)
Release builds: /O2, /MT, /Zi and /arch:SSE2 enabled.
Debug builds: /MTd and /Zi enabled.
CPU requirements: Intel Pentium 4 or newer, AMD Athlon 64 or newer
OS requirements: Windows XP SP2 or newer

Compiling SDL needs the DirectX 5 SDK. I'm not sure about the license, so you
have to find it by yourself. If found extract it in a folder called "dx5sdk".

Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt (32 or 64bit) and execute build_vs2005.cmd
or build_vs2010.cmd
The resulting files appear in vs2005 or vs2010 respectively.
Please note that the boost (http://www.boost.org/) headers are not included
because of their gigantic filesize.
