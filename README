This repo provides build files to compile the libs used by the EasyRPG project
for Visual Studio easily.

Requirements
============

Any version of Visual Studio or Windows SDK (with compilers) installed.

DirectX SDK. February 2010 is good enough:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/1/7/F178BCE4-FA19-428F-BB60-F3DEE1130BFA/DXSDK_Feb10.exe

How to compile
==============

Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt (32 or 64bit) and execute "build TOOLSET"
Replace TOOLSET with one listed below (e.g. v100)
The only official supported toolset is v100, but others should work, too.

Compiler flags and requirements:
Release builds: /O2, /MD, /Zi and /arch:SSE2 enabled.
Debug builds: /MDd and /Zi enabled.
CPU requirements: Intel Pentium 4 or newer, AMD Athlon 64 or newer
OS requirements: Depending on the toolset, v100 needs Windows XP SP2 or newer

Common toolsets
===============

Command line arguments for the target toolset (assuming that the toolset is
installed):
v80 - Visual Studio 2005
v90 - Visual Studio 2008
v100 - Visual Studio 2010
v110 - Visual Studio 2012
v110_xp - Visual Studio 2012 with Windows XP support
v120 - Visual Studio 2013
v120_xp - Visual Studio 2013 with Windows XP support
windows7.1sdk - Windows 7.1 SDK (compiler same as v100)

After compiling
===============

The resulting files appear in build\TOOLSET.
The boost (http://www.boost.org/) headers are not included because of their
gigantic filesize.
The boost folder must be placed in build\include\boost.

You must also set the environment variable EASYDEV_MSVC to the "build" folder
otherwise the EasyRPG project file can't find the libraries.
To create new environment variables enter the "Windows Control Panel" and
select "System" (or enter "environment variable" in the search field).
Sometimes new environment variables are not detected. Logout and -in again in
order to fix this.
